# Pascal's Triangle

## Overview
This project implements a Python function to generate Pascal’s Triangle. The function returns a list of lists of integers representing the triangle, where each row is formed by the sum of the two elements directly above it. The task involves utilizing Python programming skills including loops, lists, and arithmetic operations.

## Concepts
- **Lists and List Comprehensions**: Creating and modifying lists to represent rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Functions**: Defining a function to generate the triangle.
- **Loops**: Using loops to iterate and construct each row.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Calculating elements as the sum of the two elements directly above in Pascal’s Triangle.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Pascal's Triangle
Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal’s Triangle of size `n`.

- Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.
- You can assume `n` is always an integer.

**Filename**: [0-pascal_triangle.py](./0-pascal_triangle.py)
- **Description**: The file contains the function `pascal_triangle(n)` which generates Pascal’s Triangle up to `n` rows. It follows the mathematical pattern where each element is the sum of the two elements directly above it.

## Setup Environment
- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Run the script by executing `./0-main.py` to test the function.
